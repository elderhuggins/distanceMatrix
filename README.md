# distance-matrices
The first thing you should do is create a file named "local_host.py" in the folder that contains this project folder. The local_host.py file should have a single line that instantiates the data directory, for example:
<code>
data_dir = "_data"<br/>
import sys, os<br/>
sys.path.append('distanceMatrix')
</code>
